PASSWORD GENERATOR
PROJECT OVERVIEW:
     This project is a GUI-based Password Generator built using Python and Tkinter. The application allows users to generate strong and random passwords with customizable lengths and character sets. The user-friendly interface ensures ease of use and enhances security by creating passwords that include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
TECHNOLOGIES USED:
•	Python
•	Tkinter (for GUI development)
•	Random module (to generate random passwords)
FEATURES IMPLEMENTED: 
 User-defined password length 
 Option to include/exclude numbers and special characters 
 Randomly generated secure passwords 
 Copy to clipboard functionality 
 Interactive and easy-to-use graphical interface
STEPS TAKEN IN DEVELOPMENT:
1.	Set Up the Environment – Installed Tkinter and set up the Python development environment.
2.	Designed the GUI – Created a clean and intuitive interface using Tkinter widgets such as Labels, Entry, Buttons, and Checkboxes.
3.	Implemented Password Generation Logic – Used Python’s random module to generate secure passwords based on selected options.
4.	Added Copy-to-Clipboard Functionality – Enabled users to copy the generated password with a button click.
5.	Testing and Debugging – Ran multiple tests to ensure smooth performance and error-free execution.
KEY TAKEAWAYS:
•	Learned GUI programming with Tkinter.
•	Implemented password security best practices.
•	Improved code structuring and user experience design.


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
•	Add an option to save generated passwords securely.
•	Implement a password strength meter.
•	Allow users to generate multiple passwords at once.
This project showcases skills in GUI development, Python programming, and security awareness, making it a valuable addition to a resume or portfolio.
